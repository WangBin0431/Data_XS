s is the number of photons arriving at the detector in 100 ns.
T is the detection time in microseconds.
sigma_p is the standard deviation of the optical dispersion spot in pixels.
x0,y0 is the position of the center of mass of the target in pixel coordinates.
We performed 80 sets of experiments, each with a different s,K or sigma_p.
Each set of experiments is repeated 10,000 times, and all (both aliased and non-aliased) data (RETAIN) and non-aliased data (REMOVE) obtained each time are saved in Position.
The following data are fixed values:
Quantum efficiency is 0.2 
The number of pixels is 320*320 
Spacing of each anode strip is 8 pixels in size.
The diameter of each electron cloud is the width of 5 anode intervals.
Dead time is 200ns.
